# Producer-Consumer Testing Project
## Description:
This project is an implementation and comprehensive testing of a Producer-Consumer system adhering to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. The task involves testing a "producer-consumer" program where a producer generates "Item" objects, and the consumer consumes these objects. The "Item" objects are stored in a "Buffer" object, and the consumer retrieves items from there. The producer and consumer classes are to be simulated, and only their interfaces are accessible. Both classes need to be simulated and implement the correct interfaces. The entire codebase is subject to testing, covering various aspects such as Boundary testing, Null values, Exceptions, Input/Output, Data Types, and more.

## Key Features:

Buffer Management: Implementation of a buffer for storing and managing "Item" objects.
Producer-Consumer Simulation: Simulation of producer and consumer classes with correct interfaces.
Test-Driven Development (TDD): Comprehensive testing covering Boundary testing, Null values, Exceptions, Input/Output, Data Types, etc.
Boundary Testing: Ensuring the correct behavior of the system at the edge cases and boundaries.
Exception Handling: Robust testing for various exception scenarios.
Data Integrity: Verification of data types, input/output correctness, and overall data integrity.

## Challenges:
Simulating Producer-Consumer Classes: Simulating the behavior of producer and consumer classes solely based on their interfaces.
TDD Principles: Adhering to Test-Driven Development principles throughout the testing process.
Comprehensive Testing: Ensuring thorough testing coverage for various scenarios and edge cases.

## Proposed Changes:

Consider enhancing simulation of producer and consumer classes for more realistic behavior.
Evaluate additional edge cases and scenarios for testing coverage.
Review and enhance documentation for clarity.

## Testing Approach:

Boundary Testing: Verify system behavior at the boundaries of input parameters.
Null Values Testing: Ensure robust handling of null values throughout the system.
Exception Testing: Comprehensive testing for different exception scenarios.
Input/Output Testing: Validate correctness of input and output operations.
Data Types Testing: Confirm the system's ability to handle various data types correctly.
